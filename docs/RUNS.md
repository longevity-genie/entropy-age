# Runs

The brief for the runner seat (`docs/seats/RUNNER.md`): the batch runs to do on the cluster, in order,
written by the maintainers and the lead. The runner works it top down and records what happened in
`docs/RUN_STATUS.md` and `docs/RUN_LOG.md`; a run that is done leaves this file.

Each entry is a section `## Rn — name` with:

- the command (`uv run entropy-age fetch ...` or `uv run entropy-age figures NAME --scale paper --seed S`);
- the roadmap item it serves (`RMn`);
- what the lead needs back (a table, a figure, a number), and anything the run must not do.

No runs are planned yet.
